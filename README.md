## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the backend services of our application. All backend services are currently running.

## Login Payload  `/users/save` 

- To log in, you can use the following payload   :{ "email":"admin@test.com", "password":1234 }    or run and add your custom login credential to be allowed to save in H2 [ users/save]


## Access to `/orders/all`

- Access to the `/orders/all` endpoint is enabled and allowed for all users.

## To-Do List
3. **Testing**: I need to add unit and integration tests.
4. **Docker Integration**: I've added a Dockerfile to the repository for containerization, but it has not been built yet. We should build and deploy our application using Docker for better manageability and scalability.
